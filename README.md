ARPShield is a security application that uses a combination of simple yet strategic methodologies and powerful techniques to detect ARP based attacks. Using passive modules ARPShield detects hackers inside your network. ARP attacks allow an attacker to silently eavesdrop or manipulate all your data that is sent over the network. This include documents, emails, or VoiceIP conversations. ARP spoofing attacks go undetected by firewalls and operating system security: Firewalls do not protect you against ARP based attack.
